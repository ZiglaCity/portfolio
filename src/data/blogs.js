      "Who is Zigla beyond the code? Not everyone gets to find out—but if you're here, you're close.",
    content: `
    <p>I’m more than the commits, the PRs, or the clean UI.<br />
    Behind the screen, there’s a mind that rarely sleeps, and a soul wired a little differently.</p>

    <p>Some people know me as <strong>Solomon</strong> — calm, observant, the guy who listens more than he speaks.<br />
    Others know me as <strong>Zigla City</strong> — the late-night builder, the architect of chaos and clarity, the one turning caffeine and silence into something real.</p>

    <p>Truth is, I'm a contradiction.<br />
    I love clean systems, but I thrive in creative mess.<br />
    I chase perfection in code but live life in raw draft mode.<br />
    I’m the guy who will debug an API at 3AM, then go write a poem nobody will ever read.</p>

    <p>I’m not trying to be your average dev. I want to build tools that outlive me.<br />
    I want to create things that feel like they were pulled straight out of thought — pure, raw, unfiltered.<br />
    Sometimes, I disappear from the socials and vanish into work. That’s not by accident — I value depth over noise.</p>

    <p>This blog? It’s not a diary. It’s a digital trail.<br />
    For the curious. The few who ask: <em>“Yo, who’s really behind the keyboard?”</em></p>

    <p>So if you're here, maybe you get it.<br />
    Maybe you're not just scrolling.<br />
    Maybe you're looking for the real me.</p>

    <p><strong>You’re getting close.</strong></p>

    excerpt:
      "Dream big or stay stuck. Here’s what drives me and where I’m headed.",
    content: `
    <p>They say dreams should scare you.<br />
    Mine? They terrify me — and that’s how I know they’re real.</p>

    <p>I don’t just want to write code.<br />
    I want to architect systems that power the future.<br />
    AI-driven platforms. Secure infrastructures. Tools that redefine how we interact with technology.</p>

    <p>I imagine a world where my solutions run silently in the background of your life, making things faster, safer, smarter.<br />
    A world where someone says, “Who built this?” — and my name comes up.</p>

    <p>The big dream isn’t fame. It’s impact.<br />
    I don’t need the spotlight. I need legacy.<br />
    I want my fingerprints on the future, even if nobody sees them.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, I ask myself: “Is this too much?”<br />
    Then I remember: comfort never built history.<br />
    Discomfort is the price of doing something legendary.</p>

    <p>So here’s the plan: keep building, keep breaking limits, keep chasing the ideas that others call impossible.<br />
    Because if your dreams don’t make people doubt you, they’re too small.</p>

    <p><strong>This is The Big Dream. And I’m running toward it.</strong></p>
