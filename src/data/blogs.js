    <p>I’m more than the commits, the PRs, or the clean UI.<br />
    Behind the screen, there’s a mind that rarely sleeps, and a soul wired a little differently.</p>

    <p>Some people know me as <strong>Solomon</strong> — calm, observant, the guy who listens more than he speaks.<br />
    Others know me as <strong>Zigla City</strong> — the late-night builder, the architect of chaos and clarity, the one turning caffeine and silence into something real.</p>

    <p>Truth is, I'm a contradiction.<br />
    I love clean systems, but I thrive in creative mess.<br />
    I chase perfection in code but live life in raw draft mode.<br />
    I’m the guy who will debug an API at 3AM, then go write a poem nobody will ever read.</p>

    <p>I’m not trying to be your average dev. I want to build tools that outlive me.<br />
    I want to create things that feel like they were pulled straight out of thought — pure, raw, unfiltered.<br />
    Sometimes, I disappear from the socials and vanish into work. That’s not by accident — I value depth over noise.</p>

    <p>This blog? It’s not a diary. It’s a digital trail.<br />
    For the curious. The few who ask: <em>“Yo, who’s really behind the keyboard?”</em></p>

    <p>So if you're here, maybe you get it.<br />
    Maybe you're not just scrolling.<br />
    Maybe you're looking for the real me.</p>

    <p>They say dreams should scare you.<br />
    Mine? They terrify me — and that’s how I know they’re real.</p>

    <p>I don’t just want to write code.<br />
    I want to architect systems that power the future.<br />
    AI-driven platforms. Secure infrastructures. Tools that redefine how we interact with technology.</p>

    <p>I imagine a world where my solutions run silently in the background of your life, making things faster, safer, smarter.<br />
    A world where someone says, “Who built this?” — and my name comes up.</p>

    <p>The big dream isn’t fame. It’s impact.<br />
    I don’t need the spotlight. I need legacy.<br />
    I want my fingerprints on the future, even if nobody sees them.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, I ask myself: “Is this too much?”<br />
    Then I remember: comfort never built history.<br />
    Discomfort is the price of doing something legendary.</p>

    <p>So here’s the plan: keep building, keep breaking limits, keep chasing the ideas that others call impossible.<br />
    Because if your dreams don’t make people doubt you, they’re too small.</p>

    content: `
    <p>Most people know me as Zigla — the guy building systems and chasing big tech dreams.<br />
    But let me pull back the curtain: <strong>I wasn’t always just about code.</strong></p>

    <p>Before the screens, I lived in motion.<br />
    Freestyle football wasn’t a side thing — it was my obsession.<br />
    I’d spend hours perfecting spins and flicks, posting videos that hit thousands of views.<br />
    At my peak, I had <strong>3K Instagram followers</strong> just watching me turn a ball into art.</p>

    <p>And then there was music.<br />
    Back in high school, I lived in the studio.<br />
    Writing lyrics that felt like truth, spitting bars over beats that shook the classroom walls.<br />
    I wasn’t just coding — I was rhyming, flowing, building verses with the same precision I now put into my functions.</p>

    <p>But that’s not all.<br />
    I was a dancer — and not just any dancer.<br />
    Back in junior high, I was <strong>the best in my area</strong>.<br />
    Every move had energy. Every step had confidence. I owned the floor before I ever owned a GitHub repo.</p>

    <p>Weekends? Skating was life.<br />
    Heelys in school, roller skates on the streets.<br />
    The thrill of gliding, the freedom of motion — I lived for it.<br />
    I used to do a lot, because life was about expression, not limits.</p>

    <p>Now, people ask: “What happened to all that?”<br />
    Truth is, nothing happened.<br />
    Those worlds live in me. They taught me rhythm, creativity, and flow — the same energy I bring to every line of code today.</p>

    <p>So, if you think you know me because you’ve seen my code?<br />
    Think again.<br />
    There’s always another side.</p>

    I find mine in the dark — in those sacred hours when the world forgets me, and I forget the world.</p>

    The question is — do you have the patience to listen?</p>

    <p>Merrylow wasn’t just a project.<br />

    <p>From brainstorming on rough notes to deploying on a live server,<br />
    every step tested our skills, our patience, and our drive.</p>

    <p>I took on backend and DevOps.<br />
    Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma — all wired together with care.<br />
    Secure APIs, clean architecture, automation — the works.</p>

    <p>Then came deployment.<br />
    VPS setup. NGINX configs. GitHub Actions for CI/CD.<br />
    It wasn’t glamorous, but it was real engineering — and it worked.</p>

    <p>Merrylow taught me what it takes to build from zero.<br />
    It’s not just code.<br />
    It’s persistence. It’s strategy. It’s believing in the vision when nothing exists yet.</p>

    Merrylow is only the beginning.</p>

    <p>I’ve seen projects built with stunning UI and flawless features — all destroyed by a single exploit.<br />
    Why? Because someone thought security could wait.</p>

    <p>For me, security is non-negotiable.<br />
    It’s embedded in every function, every architecture decision, every line of code.<br />
    Because a system that isn’t safe isn’t just broken — it’s dangerous.</p>

    <p>Build fast. Innovate hard.<br />
    But never, <em>ever</em> compromise on security.<br />

    <p><strong>Confession #1:</strong><br />
    I’ve Googled “How to center a div” more times than I’ve Googled my own name.<br />
    And yes, I still forget sometimes.</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #2:</strong><br />
    I drink coffee for “focus”… but really, it’s just part of the aesthetic.<br />
    Hacker movie vibes, you know?</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #3:</strong><br />
    I’ve broken production more than once and blamed it on “the API”.<br />
    (Sorry, API.)</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #4:</strong><br />
    I once spent six hours debugging a bug that didn’t exist.<br />
    The real issue? I forgot to save the file.</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #5:</strong><br />
    Sometimes I write <em>// TODO</em> in my code just to feel organized.<br />
    Do I ever come back to it? Nope.</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #6:</strong><br />
    I’ve used console.log as a debugging tool in a million-dollar codebase.<br />
    And I’d do it again.</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #7:</strong><br />
    I’ve deployed something without testing because “it should work”.<br />
    Guess what? It didn’t.</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #8:</strong><br />
    I once fixed a bug by accident… and pushed it like I knew what I was doing.</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #9:</strong><br />
    I still copy-paste from Stack Overflow like it’s a sacred ritual.<br />
    The real MVP? Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V.</p>

    <p><strong>Confession #10:</strong><br />

      <p>I stumbled on this track called <em>"I’m SOLO"</em>, and let me tell you—it’s not just a song; 
      it’s an anthem for anyone grinding silently, questioning the norms, and chasing a vision bigger than themselves.</p>

      <p>
      The lyrics hit home:  
      <em>"They try to tell me get a job, and pick a realistic goal  
      I would rather die young than live for anybody else."</em>
        
      That line? That’s everything. Because I’ve been there—the constant pressure to "fit in," to follow a predictable script, when deep down you know you’re built for something different.
      </p>

      <p>
      Ever since I started building, I’ve been mostly by myself. Not because I hate people. Not because I can’t vibe. But because purpose demands solitude. It’s where the real work happens.  
      Like the hook says:  
      <em>"I’m SOLO... Secrets only live outside  
      I’m DOLO... It’s not a lot of people that I like I know."</em>
      </p>

      <p>
      And honestly, I relate. This path can be isolating. I’ve lost relationships. Missed out on weekends. Turned down parties. But every sacrifice is a brick in the foundation of the future I’m building.  
      Would I change it? No. Because the truth is, I find peace in the work. It’s not punishment—it’s passion.
      </p>

      <p>
      So if you’re out there feeling the same—different, distant, driven—remember this: You’re not crazy for wanting more. You’re just SOLO. And maybe that’s exactly what you need to win.

      We’ve replaced simplicity with a constant chase for what’s next. We don’t sit with boredom anymore; we binge, scroll, consume. We’ve mistaken access for meaning, and now we’re paying the price.
      </p>

      <p>
      Maybe freedom was never about endless options. Maybe it’s about making a few choices that matter—and shutting the rest out.

      Tech loves buzzwords: AI, Blockchain, Innovation. And now? <strong>Diversity.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
      Companies plaster “We support women in tech” all over their job posts. Sounds great. But here’s the uncomfortable question: Are they doing it for impact… or for image?
      </p>

      <p>
      Don’t get me wrong—progress is real. Women are coding, leading, and building empires in tech like never before. But sometimes it feels like the movement has been hijacked by corporate virtue signaling. Diversity without inclusion is just a checkbox.
      </p>

      <p>
      Empowerment should never be about token seats in boardrooms or PR campaigns during Women’s Month. It’s about mentorship, equal pay, real growth opportunities—and not making women feel like they have to “prove” they belong.
      </p>

      <p>
      So here’s to the real builders—the women who don’t just want a seat at the table but are building their own tables. Respect where it’s due.

      <p>
      Let’s just say… if social energy was a battery, mine dies faster than an iPhone on 2% playing TikToks. Suddenly, I’m the quiet guy in the corner, overthinking if I should even wave at someone I know. Talking to a girl? Might as well ask me to solve world hunger first.
      </p>

      <p>
      So which one is the real me? The truth is… both. We’ve all got layers. Maybe the internet just lets me be the version of me that doesn’t need to fight social anxiety, judgment, or awkward stares. Maybe being “me” isn’t about picking one side. It’s about owning every side.

      Let’s keep it real: life isn’t always fair. Some days, it feels like the universe wakes up and says, “Let’s mess with Zigla today.” And trust me, I’ve had a few of those days lately.
      </p>

      <p>
      Not too long ago, I planned out the perfect break. A whole vacation dedicated to taking online courses, building projects, and leveling up my skills. Everything was set. And then… my laptop broke. Gone. Just like that, my entire plan went down the drain.
      </p>

      <p>
      Fast forward a few months—life seemed like it was finally picking up. I landed internships, started preparing for exams, and had projects lined up that I was genuinely excited about. Then it happened again. Got robbed. Lost my phone, my SIM cards (goodbye, 2FA logins), and my mini MiFi—the one thing that keeps me connected and working online.
      </p>

      <p>
      At first, it felt like the final straw. Like, how many times can life hit you before you tap out? But then I realized something: nobody cares. Harsh? Yeah. True? Absolutely. The world doesn’t stop spinning because Zigla had a bad day. Deadlines don’t care about your Wi-Fi. Clients don’t care about your stolen phone. And opportunities? They don’t wait for anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
      So, what now? You get up. You show up. You put in the work—even when it sucks. Because giving up doesn’t make the pain go away. It just adds regret to the list. And I refuse to live with that.
      </p>

      <p>
      Life sucks sometimes. But quitting sucks more. And if this storm doesn’t break me, then it’s only making my grind legendary. So yeah… still here. Still coding. Still dreaming. Still building. Because the only way out is through.

    <p>
      Let’s be real — some people were born on the finish line. Me? I started where the track didn’t even exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s talk academics. I’ve never been a resident on campus — not because I didn’t want to, but because I could never afford it. Do you know what that means? It means missing in-person lectures, quizzes, and those surprise attendance checks that could tank your grade. It means rushing through traffic for a 30-minute paper you might not even get to write if you’re late. And yet, somehow, I’ve managed to stay in the 95% category with a GPA above 3.8.
    </p>

    <p>
      And it wasn’t easy. There were moments I almost gave up entirely — like when the academic fee deadline was breathing down my neck and I had no idea how I was going to pay. You’re performing at your best, getting top scores, and still thinking, “What’s the point if I can’t even stay enrolled?” I applied for scholarships, nailed the interviews, but guess what? Luck never smiled. That stings in ways I can’t even explain.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the grind didn’t stop there. While juggling all that, I still fought for opportunities. And that’s how I became one of only TWO Level 200 students in my department to join A2SV — a program that handpicks the best coders on campus. I was competing against Level 300 and 400 CS and Engineering students, and in 12 of their weekly contests, I participated in 10 and finished top 3 in 8 of them. Not luck. Not privilege. Just pure willpower and work ethic.
    </p>

    <p>
      And this doesn’t end with academics or coding. My life has always been about making the most out of the least. Personality-wise? I’m the guy who can stay indoors for weeks. People in the same house can go months without seeing me. But that isolation? It’s not weakness. It’s where I build myself. A year ago, my typing speed was barely 30 WPM. I had a friend hitting 90+. Today? I type faster than him. Why? Because every second I get, I invest in me- not just typing tho!.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of this is to brag. It’s a survival story. I’ve had every reason to quit, but here I am. Because circumstances don’t define me — mindset does. Like NF said, “There’s millions of us just like you...” But here’s the question: how many make it through?
    </p>

    <p>
      So I ask again — could you survive being me?

    Here’s something funny — I could invent a whole new algorithm from scratch in a contest because I dug so deep into a problem, only to later find out the official solution was just <b>Arrays.sort()</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    And no, I’m not joking. My friends would solve the same question in under 3 minutes. I’d spend 45. Not because I was stuck — but because I was designing a full-on sorting network, convinced there had to be a trick. There wasn’t. But what I built actually worked — and they didn’t even understand how.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s the life of someone with intense reasoning ability but mid-tier (at best) memory retention. I can pick apart abstract math and physics ideas like it’s nothing. I could listen to a complex concept once, and reconstruct it with even deeper insights. But ask me what we discussed yesterday over lunch? No clue. Gone. It’s like my brain filters out what it deems “non-essential” — and trust me, it’s ruthless.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve never been good with History. Couldn’t memorize dates or timelines if you paid me. In fact, if you offered me a full scholarship plus monthly stipend to study Medicine, I’d still say no. Not because I can’t reason through the biology — but because I know I’d forget half the memorized terms before the exam. That’s just how my mind works. It optimizes for logic, not recall.
  </p>

  <p>
    But when I enter a coding contest or solve a real-world logic puzzle, it’s like Hikaru playing bullet chess with 2 seconds on the clock. Everything connects instantly. I see through the noise, I bend rules (safely), and I create solutions that weren’t even in the textbook.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s a weird paradox to live in — being brilliant in chaos and yet forgetful in calm. But I’ve learned to embrace it. Because even if I can’t remember what day it is, when the real challenge hits… I show up with answers no one else saw coming.

  <p>
    The moment you connect to the internet, you expose yourself. 
    Not because you posted a photo. 
    Not because you wrote a blog. 
    But because you simply… <strong>connected</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s clear this up real quick: <br>
    You don't need to overshare or post selfies to be vulnerable online. 
    The <em>real exposure</em> begins the second your device pings a Wi-Fi tower or connects to mobile data. 
    That tiny moment you hit <code>“I agree”</code> on terms and conditions you didn’t read—<strong>you’re already in the system</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>“But I don’t log in to anything, I just browse.”</em>  
    Lol. That was valid in 2008.  
    Today, you can’t do anything meaningful online without logging in. 
    Platforms hold content hostage until you give up your identity. 
    Some restrict research papers, downloads, or even full articles unless you’re signed in.
  </p>

  <p>
    And let’s say you somehow sneak around unlogged—what happens when your device dies mid-task? 
    No account. No autosave. No cloud sync. All that progress? <strong>Gone</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So now you’re <em>forced</em> to log in just to function. 
    And the moment you do, they know:
    <ul>
      <li>Your location</li>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>Your device model</li>
      <li>Your screen resolution, typing pattern, and more</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Illusion of Privacy</strong><br />
    “But I’ve never posted anything about myself.”  
    Cool. But… your number exists in a database somewhere.  
    Your name is on some graduation list.  
    You once gave your birthday for a discount code.  
    <strong>Bam. You’re already traceable.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I can find you in under 10 minutes with just your number.  
    You don’t have to overshare to be <em>already shared</em>.  
    The web is connected in crazy, invisible ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    So who’s safe?<br />
    Nobody.  
    Not me. Not you. Not your grandma who only likes church flyers on Facebook.  
    The question isn’t <strong>“Am I vulnerable?”</strong>  
    It’s <strong>“How well can I protect myself?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Start here:
    <ul>
      <li>Use 2FA</li>
      <li>Don’t reuse passwords</li>
      <li>Actually read what you’re agreeing to</li>
      <li>Log out if you don’t need to stay in</li>
      <li>Don’t overshare, but also… don’t be delusional</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’ve read my blogs, you probably feel like you know me.  
    Maybe you do.  
    But that doesn’t make you less vulnerable than I am.
  </p>

  <p>
    The game isn’t about avoiding exposure anymore—that ship has sailed.  
    It’s about <strong>minimizing risk</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So next time you see someone sharing their life online, stop saying, “they’re making themselves vulnerable.”  
    <strong>We all already are.</strong><br />
    The real flex?  
    <strong>Knowing how to play defense.</strong>

    <p><em>“Sorry ain’t answer I’ve been busy, lot of things been bothering me lately wish I could go back in time and erase it.”</em><br/>— GTW Mik</p>

    <p>This line been ringing in my head all day. You know, I’ve been thinking about how good I had it as a kid. Charlie, Life's been moving too fast lately. Like I'm strapped to a rocket I didn’t even ask to ride.</p>

    <p>Like...<br/>I really used to live. Life wasn’t fancy or perfect or anything like that, but I swear it felt like I had the whole world in my palm. Back then, after school? Football every single day Shoes off, socks brown, hearts racing, legs running wild. We didn’t have a stadium — we had a dusty field, two stones as goalposts, and a reason to feel alive.
    We’d chase that ball till the sun disappeared and our shadows faded into dust.</p>

    <p>And brooo, if you ever heard about a party in the hood? Best believe I was there. Not for drinks. Not for girls. But for those dancing competitions. I remember winning 1 cedi one time — deadass felt like I just hit the lottery. Split it with my boys, gave 20 pesewas each to two of them, and we ran straight to the ice cream seller like kings. </p>

    <p>Weekends? Skating. Biking. Skating again. And then maybe gambling with rubber bands like our lives depended on it. Grandpa would call me over and we’d play cards — not even for the game’s sake, but just to laugh, talk, and feel alive. I had my lil bro with me too, and we’d turn the house upside down with made-up games that made zero sense but felt like everything, break random things and then run from random beatings. </p>

    <p>Now? It’s like I’m here, but also… not really. <br>I barely want to talk to anyone. Not out of hate, just… don’t feel like it. My phone could ring twenty times and I wouldn’t flinch. Earphones in, heart locked, mind drowning in music and these dreams bigger than my head can even carry. I just stare at my dark screen — not sad, not depressed or anything like that, just… floating. </p>
    
    <p>We all wanted to grow up. Chase something bigger. Live something better. But truth is, I’d trade a thousand “busy” days for one more sunny afternoon with a rubber band in my pocket and a coin in my shoe, waiting for the next party beat to drop. </p>

    <p>But hey… <br>I ain’t sad. <br>I’m just soaking in the silence. <br>Till then…<br/>I’ll just keep floating in my own world.<br/>Shoot my shot at the grind —<br/>Hope I don’t miss it.</p>
